###### 	R code for: 
###### SPATIO-TEMPORAL RAINFALL PATTERNS IN KAPUAS BASIN ######
### Analysis and comparison of station data ###

### R FILES ###
+ run.R 		executes the analysis, it calls further scripts:
			run.R is the only file that needs to be run for a complete default analysis

+ installpackages.R	convenience script that should install all needed packages, if they are not yet installed
+ load.R 		loads in all the data and converts to appropriate formats ##
+ aggregate.R 		creates all necessary summaries and variables to be analysed ##
+ analyse.R 		plots summaries to output ##
+ compare.R		plots comparative plots to output

Called from within these files:
+ setup.R			loads common variables, functions and packages
+ homogeneity_test.R		four types of homogeneity tests
+ functions.R			contains own functions for the analysis
+ convenience_functions.R	own functions for repeated tasks, that are specific and can't be reused.

### NECESSARY FOLDER STRUCTURE ###
