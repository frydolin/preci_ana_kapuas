###### 	R code for: 
###### SPATIO-TEMPORAL RAINFALL PATTERNS IN KAPUAS BASIN ######
### Analysis and comparison of station data ###

### R FILES ###
+ run.R 		executes the analysis, it calls further scripts:
			run.R is the only file that needs to be run for a complete default analysis
			50+ warnings do appear when running run.R. Most of them concern graphics. They should all be harmless, but of course it is advisable to check.

+ installpackages.R	convenience script that should install all needed packages, if they are not yet installed
+ load.R 		loads in all the data and converts to appropriate formats ##
+ aggregate.R 		creates all necessary summaries and variables to be analysed ##
+ analyse.R 		plots summaries to output ##
+ compare.R		plots comparative plots to output

Called from within these files:
+ setup.R			loads common variables, functions and packages
+ graphic_pars.R		graphical parameters
+ homogeneity_test.R		four types of homogeneity tests
+ functions.R			contains own functions for the analysis
+ convenience_functions.R	own functions for repeated tasks, that are specific and probably can't be reused.

### NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS BEFORE RUNNING THE CODE ###
On default the analysis is run on all files within /input, for a maximum of 14 stations. The following files need adjustment if the station number is changed or the analysis should be run on a subset:
- load.R, here you can specify to exclude certain stations from the analysis. The variables "d_ts" and "stnames" need to be subsetted.
- graphic_pars.R, the "color" vector on default has 14 entries. It needs to be adjusted according to the station number.

### NECESSARY FOLDER STRUCTURE ###
# /input		# contains input data
# /output		# where output is written to
# /scripts		# all R scripts
# all other folders are created automatically

### REQUIRED INPUT DATA FORMAT###
The following data format has to be used OR adjustments need to be made to load.R
# times series of precipitation
# .csv files with two columns:
# date	rainfall
# seperator is ; 
# missing value flag is NA
# decimal sign is ,
# filenames are NNstationname.csv with NN being any two numbers
