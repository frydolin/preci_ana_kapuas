###### 	R code for: 
###### 	PRECIPITATION ANALYSIS: COMPARISON OF GROUND  STATION DATA ######

### R FILES ###
+ run.R 			executes the analysis, it calls further scripts:
				run.R is the only file that needs to be run for a complete default analysis

+ installpackages.R	convenience script that should install all needed packages, if they are not yet installed
+ load.R 			loads in all the data and converts to appropriate formats ##
+ aggregate.R 		creates all necessary summaries and variables to be analysed ##
+ analyse.R 		plots summaries to output ##
+ compare.R		plots comparative plots to output

Called from within these files:
+ setup.R			loads common variables, functions and packages
+ functions.R 		contains own functions for the analysis

### NECESSARY FOLDER STRUCTURE ###
# /input		# contains input data
# /output		# where output is written to
# /scripts 	# all R scripts
# all other folders are created automatically

### REQUIRED INPUT DATA FORMAT###
# times series of precipitation
# .csv files with two columns:
# date	rainfall
# seperator is ; 
# missing value flag is NA
